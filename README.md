# SimpleBlue

####Just another simple Ghost theme, based on handlebars, Sass and something else.

##Overview
SimpleBlue is designed and implemented personally. The theme is built in a minimal and responsive way. The live demo is here at my blog, [Zhibin Cai's snippet](http://caizhibin.com/blog).

It is how it looks like:

##Some Features
###Typography

The typesetting in SimpleBlue is optimized specifically in Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and Japanese, using [Han.css](http://css.hanzi.co) (<ruby>汉<rt>hān</rt>字<rt>zì</rt>标<rt>biāo</rt>准<rt>zhun</rt>格<rt>gé</rt>式<rt>shì</rt></ruby>). 

[Han.css](http://css.hanzi.co) is a great typesetting framework featuring style normalisation to semantic elements, typography and advanced typesetting.

###Codes highlight
Codes in this theme would be styled specially using the code highlight engine called [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/).


###Responsive and Animations

SimpleBlue also follows the responsive design. So it looks well on mobile devices. The title section is shown in great animation using [Animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/).


###SASS, Compass, Grunt

SimpleBlue is built on SASS and compiled by compass. Feel free to make modifications to the theme.

I used [Grunt](gruntjs.com/) to do the automation when I am developing, which does the compilation, minification and even testing quietly in the background.
